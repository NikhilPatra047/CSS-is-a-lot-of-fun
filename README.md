# CSS-is-a-lot-of-fun

This is a dummy web page that was created with the intent to implement what I have learned in HTML and CSS.

## Objective

This project is a part of the "front-end developer career path" course on "Scrimba". The project was a means to practice what I had learned in HTML and CSS, especially,
creating links and styling them in a way to make them look like buttons.
